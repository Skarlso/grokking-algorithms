# K-nearest

This section didn't have any code. Although it could have been both, complex, or too easy.
But I still feel like some example would have been nice. The algorithm itself is, of course,
easy. Just classify, put on a grid, and find K number of nearest neighbours. The complication lies
in how you classify and how do you compare and what features you collect.

I still might add my own implementation here though. So stay tuned for more.
